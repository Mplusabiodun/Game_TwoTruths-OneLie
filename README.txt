"TWO TRUTHS AND ONE LIE" 

It is a captivating social game that engages players in a mix of honesty and deception. 
Each participant takes a turn to present three statements about themselves: two of these are true, and one is 
a fabricated lie. The challenge for the others is to discern which statement is the falsehood. This game not 
only brings out creative storytelling but also encourages participants to share interesting facts about 
themselves, leading to surprising revelations and often, plenty of laughter. It's a simple yet effective 
way to bond, break the ice, and get to know each other better in a light-hearted, playful setting. Perfect 
for parties, team-building, or just a casual hangout with friends or family.
